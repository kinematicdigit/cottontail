Cotton Tail buffer system will attach directly to the Sturdy Bunny upgraded ERCF and is designed to work with any number of filament blocks you choose (the initial test phase will go up to 9). 

The primary goal of this project was to reduce as much resistance in the path and to remove any inconsistencies in calibration. It works with Triple Decky but will work with whatever top hat/filament block design you want. In fact, there is no limitation to the design, and it also may remove the need for magnets in them altogether. There is a spring in the couplers to alleviate all pressure on the magnets.

This system is also designed to reduce the buffer length, which will help reduce friction on the entire system. There will also be optional QoL features to work with the new BTT MMB Can board.
Features:
- Large central buffer wheel - reduces the filament's natural shape - each wheel comes pre-notched to make loading filament easier.
- Inline connection - connects to the 2020 extrusion arm
- Short Buffer Length - Can operate as low as 500mm in buffer Length
- Reduced resistance - Tests up to 200 mm/s (with Galileo 2 extruder) - may do less or more depending on your extruder motor
- Improved encoder accuracy - makes all resistance more consistent for better encoder performance and less torque needed
- Stackable Arm - Each arm is stackable for whatever combination of gates you want. They are optimized for strength and weight and provide access for loading and unloading filament
- Uses most parts from ERCP -  if you already have a kit, most parts should be interchangeable.
- Filament Detector - Each coupler has a filament detector built in. This is optional and will interface with the new BTT MMB Can board. 
- Filament indicator - Future QoL option that will include the ability to light up each gate to tell you if it is loaded/active and empty/out of filament.

### **Instructions**

**PRINT SETTINGS**

.25mm first layer, .2mm Layer Height
4 Perimeters (top, bottom, walls

Arms should be printed at .2 layer height, with 4 walls and 10% lightning infill. This will significantly reduce the amount of filament used. ABS is the recommended material or PETG.

Wheels should be printed on a smooth plate, or if you use a textured plate you may need to run it on some sandpaper afterwards to avoid too much contact with the arm. There will always be a small chance of some rubbing, but with careful pressure on the hubs when installing, you shouldn't have any major resistance.

The rest of the parts can be printed with 20-30% gyroid infill.

Be careful not to go too far past the dovetail channel- it's better to be shy than to go over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The files are labelled for how many channels. They are longer than needed in case you need to put a bypass divider or extra support. Use the matching nut and work it through the acme screw to make it smooth. A brass brush can also be used to clean it up a little. It is recommended if you make more than 9 channels, to self-source a trapezoidal bar screw (also known as ACME screw). T8, Pitch 2 is a common one. You can also use a traditional screw. Make sure to get matching nuts to add to each end for those builds. |

Don't push too hard. If it doesn't go on, use a little sandpaper on the axial to reduce it. It is a tight fit but should slide on. Your pressure on the bearings will ensure the wheel is as balanced as possible. There's a very tiny bit of gap between the wheel and the side of the arm. Don't worry too much if it isn't perfect, but you can try to balance it and spin it to check.                                                                   |
